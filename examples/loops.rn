# Loops examples

# For loop

for i = 0 to 10 {
    print(i)
}

for i = 0 to 10 step 2 {
    print(i)
}

for i in "my string" {
    print(i)
}

for i in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] {
    print(i)
}

#! Comment starts from here
for i in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] {
    if i == 3 {
        break # it is exiting the program; not just the loop it self.
    }
    print(i)
}

# While loop

var j = 11
while j < 15 {
    print(j)
    j += 1
